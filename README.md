Your first question is probably: why a local adapter?

Here are some use cases:

* You have an [rsync](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rsync) directory setup on your local system.
* You have a network mounted drive (nfs or otherwise).
* You want to test out `bitbin` without hooking up S3.
* You want a quick and dirty push to dropbox or google drive.
